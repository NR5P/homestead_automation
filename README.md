# Homestead Automation

## Why
I have yet to see a homestead automation software with the raspberry pi which does all that I want. I want something that allows control over everything from controlling irrigation for propagating plants and garden crops to controlling a greenhouse environment and even keeping live stock such as chickens safe from predators. I wanted cross platform and all options of interfacing with the system. I want the settings and status to be accessed from a web browser of any computer on the local network, app on mobile device, as well as a program on the pc or mac. I also wanted somethign which was open source so that anyone can add on to the project.

## Goals and Progress
- [ ] irrigation valve control for timed garden irrigation
- [ ] short cycle irrigation for propating and rooting plants from cuttings
- [ ] grow lights timers
- [ ] temperature control for greenhouse 
- [ ] humidity control for greenhouse
- [ ] chicken coop door controller
- [ ] graph to display water usage, requires user to input of gph based on irrigation valves used
- [ ] android app
- [ ] ios app
- [ ] pc app
- [ ] web browser access via server on pi
- [ ] terminal access over ssh console
